# etch-a-sketch

Done for my DevIsland students as part of the Odin Project

Change line thickness by changing the grid size.
Option for four colors: black, red, yellow, blue.
Every click on the grid will darken the color a little (except for black).
Click on a color again to restore it to it's original hue.
